# ML-in-Python-Coursera-Final-Project
This repository contains the final project for Machine Learning in Python Course on Coursera.

I used the training sets to build an accurate model. Then used to the test set to report the accuracy of the model. I used the following algorithms: 

1. K Nearest Neighbour
2. Decision Tree
3. Support Vector Machine
4. Logistic Regression


I reported the accuracy of the built model using the following accuracy metrics:

1. Jaccard score
2. F1-score
3. Log Loss
